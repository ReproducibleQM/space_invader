## | **What** |
**Description (abstract):** This project is about niche differentiation of lady beetles at Kellogg Biological Station (KBS), South-western Michigan, United States. The major goal of this project is to analyse long term ecological data collected since 1989 on two species of lady beetles. This project is a part of a graduate coursework in Reproducible Quantitative Methods (RQM) at Kent State University.
**Title:** Coccinella septempunctata and Harmonia axyridis caught on sticky traps in the Main Cropping System Experiment, Kellogg Biological Station, 1989-2020
**Permanent Identifier:**

**Data Source:** Data extracted from KBS LTER Main Cropping System Experiment

## | **Where** |
**Location:** Kellogg Biological Station’s Main Cropping System Experiment, and adjacent forest plots, South West Michigan.
## | **When** |
**Temporal Coverage:** 1989-05-24 to 2020-09-04. Sampling is conducted weekly during the growing season as described in the sampling protocol. Sampling periods varied from 8-15 weeks in a given year depending on crop management issues and labor availability.
**Publication Date:** When was the data made available in the place of publication (above)?
Most recent addition: 2020-09-04 (we have access to newer data, pre-publication)
## | **How** |
**Data collection process:** The standard method used to measure these organisms is a yellow sticky trap. Insects collected on sticky-trap are classified by species,family and order. The insects are counted for each treatment, replicate and station combination. The actual sticky trap location coordinates are given in UTM 16N.
Protocol - Insect Abundance - Sticky Traps (msu.edu)
**Data processing:** How did you clean the data? How are missing or null values handled? Did you write code for processing the data and where can it be found?
**File index:**
See https://github.com/ReproducibleQM/space_invader/tree/main/data
**File format/s:** Dataset saved as text file in the comma separated values (.csv) format. This file can be viewed in any text editor, or any spreadsheet software.
## Variables that appear in these data:
Year: The year the sample was collected from 1989-2020.
DATE: The date the sample was collected in mm/dd/yyyy format.
TREAT: Treatment ID of plot from 1-7, plus three forest treatments, SF, DF, and CF.
Possible values: T1- Field crop rotation, Conventional management
T2- Field crop rotation, no-till management
T3- Reduced input crop rotation with cover crop
T4- Biologically based crop rotation with cover crop
T5- Poplar (plated in 2019)
T6- Switchgrass (Alfalfa from 19
T7- Early successional community
HABITAT: The predominant plant or plant community present  in the plot, in a given year. Note that the original data file contains spelling errors that are resolved by substitution in the data cleaning script.
Maize, soybean, wheat, early successional, poplar, alfalfa, switchgrass, successional forest, coniferous forest, deciduous forest.
REPLICATE: Number identifiers for replicates of treatment plots. There are six replicates of the agricultural treatments T1-T7, and three replicates each of the surrounding forest plots, SF, CF, and DF
STATION: Sampling station within each plot, from five permanent sampling stations.
SPID: Species Identification: C7 for Coccinella septempunctata and HAXY for Harmonia axyridis.
SumOfADULTS: number of adults of that species that was in the trap at sampling time
