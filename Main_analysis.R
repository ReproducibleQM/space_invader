##### enough of all that, what about real data?
summary(LB)

#clean data
#first, we fix dates, make them ISO'ed
library(lubridate)

LB$newdate<-mdy(LB$DATE)#parses the date format used for the forest plots
LB$newdate<-mdy_hm(LB$DATE)#parses the date format used in the main plots

#well, crap, neither command gets all of the dates to parse correctly
#we have an issue because data from the main site exported with time stamps but 
#the forest site did not. Ugh.


#Christie's solution: brute force removal of timestamps
LB$DATE<-gsub(" 0:00", "", LB$DATE)#remove time stamp strings

LB$newdate<-mdy(LB$DATE)#parses the date format now used by all observations

summary(LB)#bingo! looks like it worked!
