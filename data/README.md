## | **What** |

**Description (abstract):** This project is about niche differentiation of lady beetles at Kellogg Biological Station (KBS), South-western Michigan, United States. The major goal of this project is to analyse long term ecological data collected since 1989 on two species of lady beetles. This project is a part of a graduate coursework in Reproducible Quantitative Methods (RQM) at Kent State University.

## | **Where** |

**Location:** Kellogg Biological Stationâ€™s Main Cropping System Experiment, and adjacent forest plots, South West Michigan.

## | **When** |

**Temporal Coverage:** 1989-05-24 to 2020-09-04. Sampling is conducted weekly during the growing season as described in the sampling protocol. Sampling periods varied from 8-15 weeks in a given year depending on crop management issues and labor availability.

**Publication Date:** When was the data made available in the place of publication (above)? 

        Most recent addition: 2020-09-04 (we have access to newer data, pre-publication)

## | **How** |

**Data collection process:** The standard method used to measure these organisms is a yellow sticky trap. Insects collected on sticky-trap are classified by species,family and order. The insects are counted for each treatment, replicate and station combination. The actual sticky trap location coordinates are given in UTM 16N.

**Data processing:** How did you clean the data? How are missing or null values handled? Did you write code for processing the data and where can it be found?
